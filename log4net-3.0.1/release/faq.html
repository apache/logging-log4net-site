<h2><a name="What_is_log4net"></a>What is log4net?</h2>
          
<p>
            log4net is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of
            output targets.
          </p>
          
<p>
            In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so
            that the problem can be located. With log4net it is possible to enable logging at
            runtime without modifying the application binary. The log4net package is designed
            so that log statements can remain in <i>production</i> code without incurring a
            high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not
            logging) is crucial.
          </p>
          
<p>
            At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes
            overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net (and common to all of
            the log4x libraries) is the notion of <i>
            hierarchical
            loggers</i>. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control
            which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
          </p>
          
<p>
            log4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility. There
            is a tight balance between these two requirements.
          </p>
        </div>
        
<p>
          <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
        </p>
        <a name="reliability"></a>
<div class="section" id="reliability">
<h2><a name="Is_log4net_a_reliable_logging_system"></a>Is log4net a reliable logging system?</h2>
          
<p>
            No. log4net is not reliable. It is a best-effort and <i>fail-stop</i> logging system.
          </p>
          
<p>
            By fail-stop, we mean that log4net will not throw unexpected exceptions at run-time potentially
            causing your application to crash. <b>If for any reason, log4net throws an uncaught exception</b>
            (except for <span class="code">ArgumentException</span> and <span class="code">ArgumentNullException</span>
            which may be thrown), <b>
            please open a <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/apache/logging-log4net/discussions/new?category=general">dicussion</a>
            at Github</b>. Uncaught exceptions are handled as serious bugs requiring immediate attention.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Moreover, log4net will not revert to <span class="code">System.Console.Out</span>
            or <span class="code">System.Console.Error</span> when its designated
            output stream is not opened, is not writable or becomes full. This avoids
            corrupting an otherwise working program by flooding the user's terminal because
            logging fails. However, log4net will output a single message to
            <span class="code">System.Console.Error</span> and <span>System.Diagnostics.Trace</span>
            indicating that logging can not be performed.

<li>log4net is not restricted to a predefined set of facilities.</li>
            
<li>Logging behavior can be set at runtime using a configuration file. Configuration files are in XML format.</li>
            
<li>log4net is designed to handle exceptions from the start.</li>
            
<li>log4net can direct its output to many sinks including: a file, the console, the NT EventLog or even e-mail.</li>
            
<li>log4net categorizes logging into levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL.</li>
            
<li>The format of the log output can be easily changed by implementing a new layout class.</li>
            
<li>The target of the log output as well as the writing strategy can be altered by writing a new appender class.</li>

<h2><a name="What_are_Loggers"></a>What are Loggers?</h2>
          
<p>
            The logger concept lies at the heart of log4net's configuration. Loggers are organized into a
            hierarchy and give the programmer <i>run-time</i> control on which logging statements
            are printed or not.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Loggers are assigned levels through the configuration of log4net. A log statement is
            routed through to the appender depending on its level <i>and</i> its logger.

            Contrary to the GNU Public License (GPL) the Apache Software License does not
            make any claims over your extensions. By extensions, we mean totally new code
            that invokes existing log4net code. <i>You are free to do whatever you wish with
            your proprietary log4net extensions.</i> In particular, you may choose to
            never release your extensions to the wider public. For details see the

<p>
            We are very careful not to unnecessarily change the log4net client API so that newer log4net
            releases are backward compatible with previous versions. We are a lot less
            scrupulous with the internal log4net API. Thus, if your extension is designed to
            work with the internals of a specific log4net version, then when the next release
            of log4net comes out, you will probably need to adapt your proprietary extensions to the
            new release. Thus, you will be forced to spend precious resources in order to
            keep up with log4net changes. This is commonly referred to as the &quot;stupid-tax&quot;.
            By donating the code and making it part of the standard distribution, you save
            yourself the unnecessary maintenance work.
          </p>
          
<p>
            If your extensions are useful then someone will eventually write an extension
            providing the same or very similar functionality. Your development effort will
            be wasted.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Unless the proprietary log4net extension is business critical, there is little
            reason for not donating your extensions back to the project.

            The initial port was done in June 2001, since then we have tried to remain in the

<p>
            Logging behavior can be set using configuration files which are parsed at runtime.
            Using configuration files the programmer can define loggers and set their levels.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Configuration files are specified in XML. See <span class="code">log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator</span>

<p>
            Setting the <span class="code">Threshold</span> on the Hierarchy to Level OFF will disable all
            logging from that Hierarchy. This can be done in the log4net configuration file
            by setting the &quot;threshold&quot; attribute on the log4net configuration element to &quot;OFF&quot;.
            For example:
          </p>
          
<div class="source">
<pre>

<h2><a name="What_are_the_configurable_options_for_an_appender"></a>What are the configurable options for an appender?</h2>
          
<p>
            log4net uses public properties to configure components such as
            Appenders, Layouts, Loggers etc.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Thus, any writable public property in on the appender corresponds to a
            configurable option. For example, in <span class="code">RollingFileAppender</span> the
            <span class="code">public int MaxSizeRollBackups { set; }</span> property corresponds to
            the <span class="code">MaxSizeRollBackups</span> option.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Layouts options are also defined by their writable properties. Same goes for most
            other log4net components.
          </p>

<div class="section" id="appender-level">
<h2><a name="Is_it_possible_to_direct_log_output_to_different_appenders_by_level"></a>Is it possible to direct log output to different appenders by level?</h2>
          
<p>
            Yes it is. Setting the <span class="code">Threshold</span> option of any appender extending
            <span class="code">AppenderSkeleton</span>, (most log4net appenders extend
            <span class="code">AppenderSkeleton</span>) will filter out all log events
            with a <i>lower</i> level than the value of the threshold option.
          </p>
          
<p>
            For example, setting the threshold of an appender to DEBUG will also allow INFO,
            WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages to log along with DEBUG messages. (DEBUG is the
            lowest level). This is usually acceptable as there is little use for DEBUG
            messages without the surrounding INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages.
            Similarly, setting the threshold of an appender to ERROR will filter out DEBUG,
            INFO and WARN messages but not ERROR or FATAL messages.
          </p>
          
<p>
            This policy usually best encapsulates what the user actually wants to do, as
            opposed to her mind-projected solution.
          </p>
          
<p>
            If you must filter events by exact level match, then you can attach a
            <span class="code">LevelMatchFilter</span> to any appender to filter out logging
            events by exact level match.

<p>
            Yes. When specifying the type in the configuration file you can give the assembly
            qualified name of the type. For example:
          </p>
          
<div class="source">

<p>
            The .NET runtime will try to locate the assembly called <i>MyAssembly</i>.

          </p>
          
<p>
            When loading an assembly from the GAC the fully qualified assembly name,
            including the version, culture and public key must be specified. This is
            in the standard syntax supported by <span class="code">System.Type.GetType</span>.

<h2><a name="How_do_I_get_the_Public_Key_for_an_assembly"></a>How do I get the Public Key for an assembly?</h2>
          
<p>
            The fully qualified name for an assembly includes the version, culture and
            public key. The public key is derived from the strong name used to identify
            the publisher. When referencing an assembly from the GAC the fully qualified
            name must be used. To get the version, culture and public key you can use a
            tool like the excellent .NET Reflector from Lutz Roeder available from
            <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet">http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet</a>.

<p>
            Newlines in the config file need to be escaped using an XML numeric character reference.
            The sequence that represents a CR LF is &amp;#13; &amp;#10;. The following example adds
            a header and footer to the output each followed by a newline.

<p>
            Log4net supports a pattern syntax for setting string properties similar to the
            <span class="code">PatternLayout</span> used to format the output messages.
            This pattern syntax can be used by specifying <span class="code">type=&quot;log4net.Util.PatternString&quot;</span>
            on the string property in the config file. This tells the config parser to pass the
            value to the <span class="code">PatternString</span> type before converting the result
            to a string.
          </p>
          
<p>
            The following example sets the file name for a <span class="code">FileAppender</span> to include the
            current process id by specifying the <span class="code">%processid</span> pattern in the

<p>
            Yes, there are.
          </p>
          
<p>
            You can name logging loggers by <b>locality</b>. It turns out that
            instantiating a logger in each class, with the logger name equal to the
            fully-qualified name of the class, is a useful and straightforward approach of
            defining loggers. This approach has many benefits:
          </p>
          
<ul>
            
<li>
              It is very simple to implement.
            </li>
            
<li>
              It is very simple to explain to new developers.
            </li>
            
<li>
              It automatically mirrors your application's own modular design.
            </li>
            
<li>
              It can be further refined at will.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Printing the logger automatically gives information on the locality of the log statement.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
<p>
            However, this is not the only way for naming loggers. A common alternative
            is to name loggers by <b>functional areas</b>. For example, the
            &quot;database&quot; logger, &quot;remoting&quot; logger, &quot;security&quot; logger, or the &quot;XML&quot;
            logger.
          </p>
          
<p>
            You may choose to name loggers by functionality and subcategorize by
            locality, as in &quot;DATABASE.MyApp.MyClass&quot; or
            &quot;DATABASE.MyApp.MyModule.MyOtherClass&quot;.
          </p>
          
<p>
            <i>You are totally free in choosing the names of your loggers.</i> The
            log4net package merely allows you to manage your names in a hierarchy. However,
            it is your responsibility to define this hierarchy.
          </p>
          
<p>
            <b>Note:</b> by naming loggers by locality one tends to name things by
            functionality, since in most cases the locality relates closely to
            functionality.

<p>
            You can easily retrieve the fully-qualified name of a class in a static block
            for class <span class="code">X</span>, with the statement <span class="code">typeof(X).Name</span>.
            Note that <span class="code">X</span> is the class name and span an instance.
            However because the <span class="code">LogManager.GetLogger</span> method is overloaded
            to take an instance of <span class="code">Type</span> as well as <span class="code">string</span>
            usually only the type of the class is required.
          </p>

            An equivalent and more portable solution, though slightly longer, is to use the declaring type
            of the static constructor.

            For some logger <span class="code">log</span>, writing,

<div class="source">

<p>
            incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter, that is converting both
            integer <span class="code">i</span> and <span class="code">entry[i]</span> to
            a string, and concatenating intermediate strings. This, regardless of whether
            the message will be logged or not.
          </p>
          
<p>
            If you are worried about speed, then write
          </p>
          
<div class="source">

if(log.IsDebugEnabled) 
{
  log.Debug(&quot;Entry number: &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + entry[i]);
}</pre></div>
          
<p>
            This way you will not incur the cost of parameter construction if debugging is
            disabled for logger <span class="code">log</span>. On the other hand, if the logger is
            debug enabled, you will incur the cost of evaluating whether the logger is
            enabled or not, twice: once in <span class="code">IsDebugEnabled</span> and once in <span class="code">Debug</span>.
            This is an insignificant overhead since evaluating a logger takes less than
            1% of the time it takes to actually log a statement.

<h2><a name="What_is_REALLY_the_FASTEST_way_of_not_logging"></a>What is REALLY the FASTEST way of (not) logging?</h2>
          
<p>
            So you don't think that the previous FAQ is really the fastest way
            of not logging? Well there is a faster way but it does have some
            drawbacks. Starting from:
          </p>
          
<div class="source">
<pre>
            
if(log.IsDebugEnabled) 
{
  log.Debug(&quot;Entry number: &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + entry[i]);
}</pre></div>
          
<p>
            It is possible to further eliminate the calls to <span class="code">IsDebugEnabled</span>
            so that the call is only made once per logger. If you are using one logger
            for each class then you can store the enabled state for the logger in a static
            variable in the class and then test against this variable:
          </p>
          
<div class="source">
<pre>
            
public class FastLogger
{
    private static readonly ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(FastLogger));
    private static readonly bool isDebugEnabled = log.IsDebugEnabled;

    public void MyMethod()
    {
      if(isDebugEnabled) 
      {
        log.Debug(&quot;Entry number: &quot; + i + &quot; is &quot; + entry[i]);
      }
    }
}</pre></div>
          
<p>
            So why exactly is this faster? Well to start with the <span class="code">IsDebugEnabled</span>
            is not called for each log statement, it is called once per logger. Furthermore as the
            <span class="code">isDebugEnabled</span> variable is <span class="code">private static readonly</span>
            the JIT compiler can at <i>run-time</i> optimize out the <span class="code">if</span> test altogether.
            This means that at runtime the JIT compiler won't even compile the logging statements into native code, i.e.
            all the logging just disappears.
          </p>
          
<p>
            So what is the downside to using this? Well one of the clever features of log4net is that
            you can change the logging configuration while your program is running. If you need to
            investigate an issue in your application, you don't have to stop the application, setup the
            logging and restart the application, you can change the logging configuration and the
            log4net will reload it (see <span class="code">XmlConfigurator.ConfigureAndWatch</span> APIs for more
            information). However if the JIT has compiled out all of the logging statements
            then they are gone and you can't get them back by reloading the configuration file. Effectively
            this means that the logging configuration can only be set when the application loads and
            it cannot be changed at runtime. It is up to you to decide if you need ultimate speed or need
            to be able to reload the logging configuration while the application is running.

<h2><a name="Can_the_outputs_of_multiple_client_request_go_to_different_log_files"></a>Can the outputs of multiple client request go to different log files?</h2>
          
<p>
            Many developers are confronted with the problem of distinguishing the log
            output originating from the same class but different client requests. They come
            up with ingenious mechanisms to fan out the log output to different files. In
            most cases, this is not the right approach.
          </p>
          
<p>
            It is simpler to use a context property or stack (<span class="code">ThreadContext</span>).
            Typically, one would <span class="code">ThreadContext.Properties[&quot;ID&quot;] = &quot;XXX&quot;</span>
            client specific information, such as the client's hostname, ID or any other
            distinguishing information when starting to handle the client's request.
            Thereafter, log output will automatically include the context data
            so that you can distinguish logs from different client requests even if they
            are output to the same file.
          </p>

<p>
            Before you even start trying any of the
            alternatives provided, ask yourself whether you
            really need to have multiple processes log to the
            same file, then don't do it ;-).
          </p>
          
<p>
            FileAppender offers pluggable locking models for
            this usecase but all existing implementations have
            issues and drawbacks.
          </p>
          
<p>
            By default the <span class="code">FileAppender</span> holds an
            exclusive write lock on the log file while it
            is logging. This prevents other processes from
            writing to the file.  This model is known to
            break down with (at least on some versions of)
            Mono on Linux and log files may get corrupted
            as soon as another process tries to access the
            log file.
          </p>
          
<p>
            <span class="code">MinimalLock</span> only
            acquires the write lock while a log is being
            written. This allows multiple processes to
            interleave writes to the same file, albeit with
            a considerable loss in performance.
          </p>
          
<p>
            <span class="code">InterProcessLock</span>
            doesn't lock the file at all but synchronizes
            using a system wide Mutex.  This will only work
            if all processes cooperate (and use the same
            locking model).  The acquisition and release of a
            Mutex for every log entry to be written will
            result in a loss of performance, but the Mutex
            is preferable to the use of MinimalLock.
          </p>
          
<p>
            If you use <span class="code">RollingFileAppender</span> things
            become even worse as several process may try to
            start rolling the log file concurrently.  <span class="code">RollingFileAppender</span>
            completely ignores the locking model when
            rolling files, rolling files is simply not
            compatible with this scenario.

<p>
            The simple answer is as soon as possible. The long answer is more complex.
          </p>
          
<p>
            If you are configuring log4net programmatically, i.e. by calling the
            <span class="code">XmlConfigurator.Configure</span> method then you should do so
            before you begin logging and it is reasonable to do this very soon after application
            start.
          </p>
          
<p>
            If you are configuring log4net by specifying assembly level attributes on
            your assembly then the configuration will be loaded once the first call to
            the <span class="code">LogManager.GetLogger</span> is made. It is necessary
            that the first call to <span class="code">LogManager.GetLogger</span> made
            during the process (or AppDomain) is made from the assembly that has the
            configuration attributes. Log4net will look only once and only on the first
            calling assembly for the configuration attributes.

<h2><a name="Can_I_write_a_custom_appender"></a>Can I write a custom appender?</h2>
          
<p>
            Yes. You can implement the <span class="code">log4net.Appender.IAppender</span>
            interface to create you own customized appender. We recommend that you extend the
            <span class="code">log4net.Appender.AppenderSkeleton</span> class rather than
            starting from scratch. You should implement your custom code in a assembly
            separate from the log4net assembly. To get started it is worth looking at the
            source of the <span class="code">log4net.Appender.TraceAppender</span> as an
            example of the minimum amount of code required to get an appender working.
          </p>
          
<p>
            To configure log4net to use your custom appender you need to specify the
            assembly qualified name of the appender type in the config file. For
            example:

<h2><a name="How_do_I_enable_log4net_internal_debugging"></a>How do I enable log4net internal debugging?</h2>
          
<p>
            There are 2 different ways to enable internal debugging in log4net.
            These are listed below. The preferred method is to specify
            the <span class="code">log4net.Internal.Debug</span> option in the application's
            config file.
          </p>
          
<ul>
            
<li>
              
<p>
          Internal debugging can also be enabled by setting a value in the application's
          configuration file (not the log4net configuration file, unless the log4net config
          data is embedded in the application's config file). The <span class="code">log4net.Internal.Debug</span>
          application setting must be set to the value <span class="code">true</span>.
          For example:
                </p>
              
<div class="syntax">
                
<div>
<pre class="code">
              &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;
              &lt;configuration&gt;
              &lt;appSettings&gt;
              &lt;add key=&quot;log4net.Internal.Debug&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
              &lt;/appSettings&gt;
              &lt;/configuration&gt;
          </pre></div>
              </div>
              
<p>
          This setting is read immediately on startup an will cause all internal
          debugging messages to be emitted.
                </p>
            </li>
            
<li>
              
<p>
          To enable log4net's internal debug programmatically you need
          to set the <span class="code">log4net.Util.LogLog.InternalDebugging</span>
          property to <span class="code">true</span>. Obviously the sooner this
          is set the more debug will be produced.
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
<p>
            Internal debugging messages are written to the console and to the
            <span class="code">System.Diagnostics.Trace</span>
            system. If the application does not have a console the messages logged
            there will be lost. Note that an application can redirect the console
            stream by setting the <span class="code">System.Console.Out</span>. The
            Trace system will by default send the message to an attached debugger
            (where the messages will appear in the output window). If the process
            does not have a debugger attached then the messages are sent to the
            system debugger. A utility like DebugView from
            <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sysinternals.com">http://www.sysinternals.com</a>
            may be used to capture these messages.
          </p>
          
<p>
            As log4net internal debug messages are written to the <span class="code">System.Diagnostics.Trace</span>
            system it is possible to redirect those messages to a local file. You can define
            a trace listener by adding the following to your application's .config file:
          </p>
          
<div class="syntax">
            
<div>
<pre class="code">

            To prevent silent failure of log4net as reported as <a class="externalLink" href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4NET-342">LOG4NET-342</a>,
            log4net supports a way to evaluate if it was configured and also to evaluate messages generated on startup since 1.2.11. To
            check if log4net was started and configured properly one can check the property
            <span class="code">log4net.Repository.ILoggerRepository.Configured</span> and enumerate the configuration messages as follows:

<h2><a name="Why_doesnt_the_EventLogAppender_work"></a>Why doesn't the EventLogAppender work?</h2>
          
<p>
            If you are not getting events delivered to the event log this usually indicates
            a permissions problem. Basically if the event log does not exist the EventLogAppender
            tries to create it, but you need local administrator permissions to create event logs
            (just to write into the right bit of the registry). You don't need administrator
            permissions to log to an existing event log, but it must exist. If you are using the
            event log from a web application or service using the event log can be a little tricky.
          </p>
          
<p>
            A web application will run as the user account ASPNET. This account deliberately has
            few permissions to reduce the chances of someone hacking into the web server. While the
            account has permission to write to the event log it does not have permission to create
            event sources (registry create and write access), which are needed to write to the event log.
          </p>
          
<p>
            There are a couple of solutions:
          </p>
          
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
            
<li>
              
<p>
          Make the ASPNET user a member of the Administrators group. This will work because the
          user will then have the required permissions. This is <b>not recommended</b>
          for production use.
                </p>
            </li>
            
<li>
              
<p>
          As the event source only needs to be created once for the machine, create an installer
          and configure it to create the event source.
          The installer will need to be run as Administrator (don't they all). See
          <span class="code">System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller</span> in the Microsoft .NET
          Framework SDK for an example of how to create a simple event log installer.
                </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

            The web application runs as a special user account on the web server
            called ASPNET. This account has restricted permissions to protect the
            web server from attacks. By default this account may not have permission
            to write to the file system. Make sure that the ASPNET account has
            permission to create and write to files in the directory chosen for
            logging.

            A windows service runs as a user account specified in the services
            control panel. This account may have restricted permissions, make
            sure that the account has permission to create and write to files
            in the directory chosen for logging.
          </p>
          
<p>
            A windows service is launched by windows. The current directory in
            a service is set to the windows system directory (e.g.
            <span class="code">C:\Windows\System32</span>). If you are loading
            the configuration file from the current directory then be aware
            that this path will not be the location of your assemblies.
            The best way to get the path to your assemblies is to use
            <span class="code">AppDomain.BaseDirectory</span>.
            Note that the log4net internals never use the current directory.

<h2><a name="Why_does_my_ASP.NET_web_application_stop_logging_when_deployed_on_an_IIS"></a>Why does my ASP.NET web application stop logging when deployed on an IIS?</h2>
          
<p>
            This problem has been reported by several people as issue
            <a class="externalLink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4NET-178">LOG4NET-178</a>.
            The issue seems to be caused by a broken LOG4NET configuration
            or a timing problem caused by an application shutdown event that
            floats in late after an application start event and thus LOG4NET
            stops logging immediately after it has been started.
          </p>
          
<p>
            The first thing step to troubleshoot problems is enabling
            the log4net internal debugging features as described
            <a class="externalLink" href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/faq.html#internalDebug">here</a>
            and fix all errors that pop up. If the problem still persists,
            <a class="externalLink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4NET-178?focusedCommentId=13504094&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13504094">this comment</a>
            suggests to move the LOG4NET configuration out of the
            <span class="code">web.config</span> into a separate file
            like <span class="code">log4net.config</span>. Finally,
            if both previous steps did not help and the problem still
            occurs, you can try to work around the event timing problem
            by invoking the configuration call from the class constructor as described in
            <a class="externalLink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4NET-178?focusedCommentId=13504485&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13504485">this comment</a>.

            If you use attributes to configure log4net then
            the order by which assemblies are loaded may
            determine whether you attributes are used or
            not.  Assembly load order may be different in
            DEBUG and RELEASE mode.
          </p>
          
<p>
            As stated in <a href="manual/configuration.html#attributes">
            the
            manual
          </a> the attribute will only be read for
            the first assembly that tries to use log4net.
            So it is important that you obtain your
            <tt>ILog</tt> instance as early as possible.

<p>
            For a command line application &quot;as early as

            it would be your <tt>Global.asax</tt> class

<p>
            You may have overlooked initialization code for
            log4net in your application. log4net can be
            initialized explicitly by calling one of the
            configurators
            (e.g. <tt>BasicConfigurator</tt> or
            <tt>XmlConfigurator</tt> in the
            <tt>log4net.Config</tt> namespace, or
            implicitly by including the
            <tt>[XmlConfiguratorAttribute]</tt> in the
            assembly where log4net is first used.
          </p>
          
<p>
            See <a href="manual/configuration.html">the manual</a>for more information.
            If you use attributes to configure log4net then the order by which
            assemblies are loaded may determine whether you attributes are used or not.
            Assembly load order may be different in DEBUG and RELEASE mode.

<p>
            Starting with .NET 4.5.1 ADO.NET has added
            connection resiliency which is supposed to
            re-establish the connection as part if the
            framework.  As a result log4net doesn't know the
            connection is broken and will never attempt to
            re-establish the connection.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Unfortunately re-connecting doesn't seem to be
            working reliably.  A workaround may be to add
            <tt>ConnectRetryCount=0</tt> to your
